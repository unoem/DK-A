A task manager web application coding task for DK&A UX Engineer position.

I do not have much experience in front-end coding. I am afraid I was not able to make the user interface
as pretty as I would have liked.

I tried to select colours that compile with WCAG 2.2.

This low-fidelity MVP shows what the final product would be like.

There are still some issues, such as:
 - filter does not work,
 - the maximum length of the tasklist name does not work,
 - it is not accessible.
 - changes are not saved
